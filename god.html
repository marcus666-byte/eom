        <h2>A STORY OF FATHER AND SON</h2>
          <p>It is a new beginning for Kratos. Living as a man, outside the shadow of the gods, he seeks solitude in the unfamiliar lands of Norse mythology. With new purpose and his son at his side, Kratos must fight for survival as powerful forces threaten to disrupt the new life he has created...</p>
          
          <h2>Bold New Beginning<br /></h2>
          <p>His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat, breathtaking scale, and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew.</p>
          
          <h2>A Second Chance<br /></h2>
          <p>Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.</p>
          
         <h2>The Leviathan Axe<br /></h2>
          <p>A new main weapon with new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.</p>
